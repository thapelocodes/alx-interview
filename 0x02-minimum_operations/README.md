# 0x02. Minimum Operations

- Author: Thapelo M Moumakoe
- Language: `Python`
- Subject: `Algorithm`

This project needs an understanding of several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

Here are the resources used in devising the solution:
