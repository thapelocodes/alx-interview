For this project, the challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive intergers.

## Concepts Needed:

1. **Prime Numbers**:
   - Understanding what prime numbers are.
   - Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.
2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.
3. **Game Theory**:
   - Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
   - Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.
4. **Dynamic Programming/Memoization**:
   - Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
5. **Python Programming**:
   - Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
   - Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
