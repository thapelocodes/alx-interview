For this project the objective is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculations is crucial for this task.

## Concepts Needed:

1. **2D Arrays (Matrices)**:
   - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
   - Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contirbutes to the perimeter of the island.
3. **Counting Techniques**:
   - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island's perimeter.
4. **Problem-Solving Strategies**:
   - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating the contribution to the preimeter.
5. **Python Proramming**:
   - Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
   - Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
