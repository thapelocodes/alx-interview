For this project we work on UTF-8 Validation in Python using Bitwise Operations, knowledge of the UTF-8 Encoding Scheme, List Manipulation, Boolean Logic and Data Representation skills.

## Concepts Needed:

1. **Bitwise Operations in Python**:
    - Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like `AND` (`&`), `OR` (`|`), `XOR` (`^`), `NOT` (`~`), and shifts (left [`<<`], right [`>>`]).
    - [Python Bitwise Operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)

2. **UTF-8 Encoding Scheme**:
    - Familiarity wwith the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
    - Understading the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
    - [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)

    - [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)

3. **Data Representation**:
    - How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
    - Handline the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

4. **List Manipulation**:
    - Iterating through lists, accessing list elements and understanding list comprehensions.
    - [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

5. **Boolean Logic**:
    - Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
